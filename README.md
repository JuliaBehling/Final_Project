# Presentation:
### Topic Selection:
Our selected topic aims to predict what combined ecological factors best determine the likelihood of a G-Class Fire. G-Class fires are largescale burned areas, reaching a size greater than 5,000 square acres. Ecological factors include temperature and precipitation rates. 

### Reason for Topic Selection:
The State of California has reached an unprecedented crisis in annual wildfire size and intensity. Decades of well-intended fire suppression techniques has led to an overabundance of combustible material throughout the natural landscape. Partnered with unparalleled high temperatures and drought, residents of California suffer from poor air quality, possibility of home loss, and risk to personal safety.  
California is a large mass with varying vegetation types, temperature, and moisture regimes. We selected this topic to determine if it is possible to predict wildfire size based on ecological factors. As wildfires continue to proliferate, and devastating events such as the Camp Fire in Paradise California (An event which led to the loss of over 11,000 homes and 85 deaths); Prediction models such as this will need to be utilized for the sake of public safety.

### Description of Source Data:
We will be applying the following data source for this analysis:

* #### Data Source: US Wildfire Data:
  * https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/california-wildfire-incidents-20132020

### Questions We Hope to Answer:
1.	Which ecological factors are the best predictors of large, catastrophic fires?
2.	Is there a statistically significant correlation between wildfire size to precipitation, humidity, windspeeds, temperature? 
4.	Does the distance between wildfire and the nearest fire facilities determine the size of the wildfire?
5.	Does funding/availability of resources affect the ability of different counties to fight wildfires in California?
