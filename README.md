# Presentation:
### Topic Selection:
Our selected topic aims to predict what ecological factor best determines wildfire size. 

### Reason for Topic Selection:
The State of California has reached an unprecedented crisis in annual wildfire size and intensity. Decades of well-intended fire suppression techniques has led to an overabundance of combustible material throughout the natural landscape. Partnered with unparalleled high temperatures and drought, residents of California suffer from poor air quality, possibility of home loss, and risk to personal safety.  
California is a large mass with varying vegetation types, temperature, and moisture regimes. We selected this topic to determine if it is possible to predict wildfire size based on ecological factors. As wildfires continue to proliferate, and devestating events such as the Camp Fire in Paradise California (An event which led to the loss of over 11,000 homes and 85 deaths); Prediction models such as this will need to be utilized for the sake of public safety.

### Description of Source Data:
We will be applying the following data source for this analysis:

* #### Data Source: US Wildfire Data:
  * https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/california-wildfire-incidents-20132020

### Questions We Hope to answer:
1.	Is there a statistically significant correlation between wildfire size to the quantity of fire relief stations per County. 
2.	Does funding and or socieconomic status of a county factor into the ability to fight Fires?
3.	what other factors play into creating a fire prediction model?
