### Topic Selection:
Our selected topic the compares correlation between the size of California's wildfires to the quantity of available fire relief resources within each county. 

### Reason for Topic Selection:
The State of California has reached an unprecedented crisis in annual wildfire size and intensity. Decades of well-intended fire suppression techniques has led to an overabundance of combustible material throughout the natural landscape. Partnered with unparalleled high temperatures and drought, residents of California suffer from poor air quality, possibility of home loss, and risk to personal safety.  

We selected this topic to determine if quanity of fire-relief resources helps mitigate wildfire size. California is divided into 58 counties. We are curious if the level of availability and amount of funding to resources Mitigates the wildfire quantity and size. 

As fires increase, and devestating problems like paradise and chino, we want to know if our model can accurrately predict size and see if resources assist in fire mitigation. 


### Description of Source Data:
We will be utilizing 2 different data sources for this analysis:

* #### Data Source 1: US Wildfire Data:
  * https://www.kaggle.com/capcloudcoder/us-wildfire-data-plus-other-attributes
* #### Data Source 2:
  *   

Questions they hope to answer with the data:
1.	Is there a statistically significant correlation between wildfire size compared to quantity of fire relief stations per county. 
2.	DOes funding and or socieconomic status of a county factor into the
3.	what other factors play into creating a fire prediction model?
