So, we used a lambda function to convert the 'fire_size_class' column to a binary code, with 'G' being equal to 1, and every other class being set to 0. We eventually converted the model to work with multiple classes so that it could predict any class 'B' through 'G' (since this dataset does not contain 'A' class fires). "
